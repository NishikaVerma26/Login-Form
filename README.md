# Login-Form
Using Html & Css🔻

A login form is a common user interface element used on websites and web applications to allow users to authenticate their identity and gain access to restricted areas or features.

✳️The form element is used to group together the input fields for the login form.

🔹Within the form element, there are two input fields:
one for the user's username or email address and another for the user's password.

🔹Each input field has a label element associated with it to provide context and improve accessibility.

🔹The label elements are also styled to ensure they are visually consistent with the rest of the form.

🔹The submit button allows the user to submit their login information to the server.
